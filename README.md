## My process
I used the figma design to extract measurements such as the font, text size, text weight, padding, margin, and gaps, etc. 

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS 
- Flexbox


### What I learned
I learned how to get exact measurements from the figma design. I got comfortable with extracting the details and measurements from the figma tools in order to manually write the CSS code and semantic HTML.
